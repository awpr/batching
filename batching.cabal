name:           batching
version:        0.1.0.0
synopsis:       An Applicative Functor deferring actions to run in a batch later.
description:    This provides the type Batching, an Applicative which defers request-response
                exchanges of a fixed type, to be performed in a single batch.  This means you
                can write code that appears to issue requests and immediately receive their
                responses, but process the requests jointly all at once.
